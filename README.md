**Assignment 1**

There are 3 types of datasets given below. The details of these three datasets are:

a) ​Linearly separable:​These are 2-dimensional artificial data of 2 classes that are linearly
separable. Each class has 1000 data points.

b) ​Non-linearly separable​: These are 2-dimensional artificial data of 2 classes that are
non-linearly separable. Each class has 1000 data points.

c) ​Real-world: ​Real-world data of 3 classes. (Number of data points for class1 = 2388, class2
= 2164 & for class3 = 2291)

Perform
1. Classification using Bayesian classifier (including parameter estimation and decision)
2. Classification (only for the 2 artificial datasets) when you approximate the pdfs via
normalized histograms (considering independence between features - thus, involving 1D
histogram computations for each of the two features)
In both cases, do the following:
For each task, you can divide the data into training and testing parts.
Build the model with the training data and evaluate its performance using the test data.
A typical training testing ratio can be 80% - 20%
Make a confusion matrix to show your results.
For the artificial datasets, also show a 2D scatter plot for the training data and test data with
different colours. Also, points for different classes should also be shown in different colours.
